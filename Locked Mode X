This is a Google locked mode bypass!

## Instructions:
1. Open two windows of the locked form.
2. Click both of their continue buttons at the EXACT same time. Too late and it'll work as normal. You should practise first by creating your own locked forms and previewing them.
3. You should be in locked mode now, but it will only show a blank window with a forms icon at the bottom left. Click it.
4. It should now show the enter locked mode screen on the form when you're already in locked mode. Click continue.
5. Click the overview button on your keyboard. You'll be able to see all the windows, and hence "exit" locked mode. You can still return to the form and complete it.

## Notes:
-> You cannot screenshot until you complete the form properly! <br>
-> This is very buggy! <br>
-> You might notice that locked mode is an app called Assessment Assistant? <br>
